4e4 data points

filtering: 1e5 iterations: 26.6s

NEO: 8e5 iterations: 27.7s
ASO: 8e5 iterations: 27.9s

thresholding 1000 iterations

update freq: 1      27.6s
update freq: 100  28.4s
update freq: 1000 27.6s


The results are not quite as expected.

First of all, ASO and NEO takes similar time for running. It could result from the way instructions are compiled.

Also, increasing update freqeuncy do not reduce the running time. That could because of the logic of the program or there is a bottleneck.


In addition, increasing the update frequency does not effect much about the accuracy, and sometimes it can even be improved, 
even if it is only updated everytime when a spike is detected.
